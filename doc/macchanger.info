`-s'
`--show'
     Print the current MAC address and exit.

`-e'

Example invocations
*******************

The simple case is that you just want change the hardware address of
the first ethernet network interface for a fully random one:

   # `macchanger -r eth0'

   Long options are supported. The following change the MAC address for
another one of the same kind (for example, wireless):

   # `macchanger -a wifi0'

   To execute this examples, the interface must be down, otherwise
`macchanger' will be exit with an error message.
